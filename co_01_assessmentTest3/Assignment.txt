In this task we consider interesting patterns that we can see on a digital clock.
Such clock displays current time using format "HH:MM:SS" where:
 HH is the hour of the day (0 through 23) as two decimal digits
 MM is the minute within the hour (00 through 59) as two decimal digits
 SS is the second within the minute (00 through 59) as two decimal digits
 
 Note that leading zeros if needed
 
 We say that a point in time is interesting if the clock needs at most two distinct digit to display it
 for example 13:31:33 and 02:20:22 are both interesting, because digital clock can display it using only digits 1 and 3 in the first case
 or 0 and 2 in the second case. 00:00:00 is interesting too as it can be displayed using only 0,
 but 15:45:14 is not due to the fat that more than two digits are used.
 Note that the delimiter character ":" is always present and does not count as one of the displayed digits
 
 The task is to count interesting points in time in a given period of time.
 
 Write a function Solution (String s, String t) 
 that given string s and t representing time in the format "HH:MM:SS" returns the number of interesting points between s and t (inclusive)
 
 For example, given "13:13:00" and "15:15:12" your function returns 1 because there is only one interesting point (namely 15:15:11),
 given "22:22:11" and "22:22:23" your function returns 3 because interesting point are "22:22:11", "22:22:11" and "22:22:23"
 
 Assume that 
  	string s and t follow the format "HH:MM:SS" strictly
	string s describe a point in time before t on the same day
