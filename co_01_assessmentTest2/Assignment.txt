Write a function that given an array A on N integers return the largest integer K with k>0 such that both k and -k exists in array A.
If there is no such integer, the value 0 should be returned.

For example:

given A = [3,2,-2,5,3] the function should return 3
given A = [1,1,2,-1,2,-1]  the function should return 1
given A = [1,2,3,-4]  the function should return 0

Write an efficient algorithm with the following assumptions:

N is an integer in the range [1...100,000]
each element of the array A is an integer within the range[-1,000,000,000...1,000,000,000]
